# UIUC-Course-Data-Explorer

This was a personal project in which I analyzed UIUC's course data with R and used the Shiny library, along with some CSS, to create a website that allows other UIUC students to interact with and explore the results of my analysis. Students can use the website's features to search for specific courses, professors, subjects, and gen eds.
